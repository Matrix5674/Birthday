          Happy Birthday!
          Ik we kinda just met this year but I like doing things like this for people I care about on their first birthdays with me. 
          I know I talk about CS sometimes and you prolly don't understand much of it but I wanted 
          to make something for you and this is the best way I could think of doing it ðŸ˜ƒ. 
          Anyway, I hope everything goes great for you today. Go somewhere, eat cake or smth, or read, have fun shortie.
